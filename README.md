# I Spy with My Little Eye: Open-Source Code in my SAS®  Model Studio Project!  

SAS®  Model Studio is the tool of choice for many predictive modelers and machine learning experts in SAS®  Viya. Pipelines make it much easier to quickly run a series of competing models - and to put a champion model into product.  But did you know how easy it is to incorporate open-source models into the pipeline? No? Well, then come join us to learn how!
